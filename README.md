## Introduction

In today's world of software development, automation plays a vital role in ensuring quality and efficiency. This project focuses on using Playwright for browser automation, providing a hands-on approach to understanding end-to-end testing. The Playwright framework allows developers to automate interactions with web browsers, making it an essential tool for quality assurance (QA).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. This project is built using TypeScript, which adds type safety to your code, making it easier to maintain and scale.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohiddin77/playwright101-lambdatest-assignment.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd playwright101-lambdatest-assignment
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start using the project. The main entry point for running the tests is through the command line.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

This command will execute all the test scripts defined in the project. You can also run specific tests by providing the test file name.

## Testing

This project employs end-to-end testing using Playwright. The tests are designed to cover various scenarios to ensure that the application behaves as expected across different browsers.

### Test Structure

The tests are organized in the `tests` directory. Each test file contains a series of test cases that validate specific functionalities of the application.

### Running Tests

You can run tests in different browsers. To specify a browser, you can modify the test command as follows:

```bash
npm run test -- --browser=firefox
```

Supported browsers include:

- Chromium
- Firefox
- WebKit

## Continuous Integration

This project integrates with CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing process. You can set up a CI tool like GitHub Actions or CircleCI to run the tests on every commit or pull request.

### GitHub Actions Example

To set up GitHub Actions, create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm run test
```

This configuration will ensure that your tests run automatically on every push or pull request.

## Cross-Browser Testing

Cross-browser testing is crucial to ensure that your application functions correctly on different browsers. Playwright simplifies this process by allowing you to run tests on multiple browsers with minimal configuration.

To perform cross-browser testing, you can use the `--browser` flag when running tests, as mentioned earlier. This flexibility helps catch browser-specific issues early in the development process.
